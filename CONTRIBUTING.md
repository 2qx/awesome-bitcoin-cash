# Motivating Principles

This project was created to serve as a resource for developers, and also from 
frustration with lists of dead, inactive, abandoned or closed-source projects.

In an effort to keep this list maintainable, the idea is to be somewhat picky about what is added,
without being a snob.  The **guiding metric should be end-user adoption** and not one's personal
opinions about bitcoin. 

All the projects and links use Bitcoin Cash, some do so while supporting other currencies, which is awesome.

# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

## Before you start

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.

## Editorial Guidelines

- Software should be actively maintained and up-to-date with the most recent hard-fork, if that's needed.
- Projects and apps should be functional and ideally have usage by the community.
- Projects which are large and multifaceted may appear in multiple places, but the same link should never be duplicated.
- Everything should be awesome: open-source, functional, uses Bitcoin Cash, have documentation and tests, or has most of these.
- You should not suggest a project you created.

## Formatting 

- Use the following format: `[project](link) - a short description.`
- If source code and documentation are available, those may be linked as well: `[project](link) [src](link) [docs](doc) - ...`
- Try to describe projects in their own words.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace. 

Thank you for your suggestions!
