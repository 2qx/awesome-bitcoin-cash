**note**

In the lead up-to the chain fork with BTC, certain members of the small-block side [attempted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325) to make amendments and revisions to the original whitepaper.  For this reason, the original bitcoin whitepaper is actively monitored and checked for integrity.
