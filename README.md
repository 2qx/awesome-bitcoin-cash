- [Bitcoin Cash Research](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/) - Site dedicated to technical discussion.

## CHIP Process

Protocol changes, software standards and application specifications may be proposed by anyone. The recommended process for consensus building and conflict reduction is known as the Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) Process.

- [CHIP Guidelines](https://gitlab.com/ggriffith/cash-improvement-proposals/-/blob/master/CHIP-2020-11-CHIP-Guidelines.md)
- [CHIPs: A more detailed process recommendation](https://gitlab.com/im_uname/cash-improvement-proposals/-/blob/master/CHIPs.md)
- [CHIPs](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/c/chips/) - a dynamic list of proposed standards
- [List of CHIPs](https://bch.info/chips) - documents that record proposals to upgrade the Bitcoin Cash protocol, and their ongoing progress, both technical and consensus-building.

### Previous consensus changes, May 2023:
