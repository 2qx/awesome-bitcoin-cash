Bitcoin Cash is one chain of Satoshi Nakamoto's blockchain invention which was deliberately hard-forked on August 1st, 2017. It shares the whitepaper, first block, and all bitcoin block history prior to the fork. It attempts to implement the central idea outlined in that paper.

- [List of CHIPs](https://bch.info/chips) - documents that record proposals to upgrade the Bitcoin Cash protocol, and their ongoing progress, both technical and consensus-building.
  
### Upcoming consensus changes, May 2023:

- [CHIP-2021-01 Restrict Transaction Version (v1.0)](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin.cash/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-01-Restrict%20Transaction%20Versions.md)

## Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP Token)

Simple Ledger Tokens (SLP) was an early implementation of tokens as data stored on Bitcoin Cash. Due to issues with both scale, usability and validation, this functionality was migrated to be a first class feature of Bitcoin Cash with new script code. 

While some projects are phasing out use of SLP, it still exists along side Bitcoin Cash, and may still be supported by some software or sites. 

### Protocols

- Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) [[specs]](https://slp.dev) - for handling ERC-20 style tokens.
- [Simple Ledger Postage Protocol](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-postage-protocol.md) - Protocol for sending SLP tokens without BCH "gas".
