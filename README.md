# Whitepaper

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin Cash is one chain of Satoshi Nakamoto's blockchain invention which was deliberately hard-forked on August 1st, 2017.  It shares the whitepaper, first block, and all bitcoin block history prior to the fork.  It attempts to implement the central idea outlined in that paper.

Below is a copy of the original nine page whitepaper:
